### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
* [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (if you plan to run a local development server)

#### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your‑username/calculator‑app.git
   cd calculator‑app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (optional, only if you add a dev server)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Running Locally

* **Without a server**:
  Simply open `index.html` in your browser.

* **With a local server** (e.g., using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)):

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Then navigate to `http://localhost:5500` (or whichever port your server uses).

### Usage

1. Enter numbers by clicking the on‑screen buttons or typing on your keyboard.
2. Use operators (`+`, `–`, `×`, `÷`) to build your expression.
3. Press `=` or the Enter key to compute.
4. Click “C” (Clear) to reset or “⌫” (Backspace) to delete the last character.
